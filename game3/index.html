<h2>Detention Escape</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
While the game is loosely based on the children's game of "red light, green light", this game is different by 
	having four directions of "checking" by the detector and there are obstacles (students) to hinder your success.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This game features a new level on every playthrough because of the randomly generated obstacles (students), and the random
	behavior of the detector (teacher). Also, it features game states to give the game possibility for replay without having
	to restart the webpage.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
From this prototype, I learned more about the P2 physics system as well as how to handle collisions between character and groups.
	It was difficult to get used to the style of coding when game states are involves due to the numerous "this.xxx" statements 
	that are needed. Also, it was difficult to create sprites/graphics at a level of satisfaction that I wanted. Eventually
	had to compromise for a more realistic finish time.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Loading screen/bar: self-made</li>
<li>Main menu screen: self-made</li>
<li>Character sprites: self-made</li>
<li>Music: "School" by Komiku  <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Komiku/Captain_Glouglous_Incredible_Week_Soundtrack/school">Link to song</a></li>
<li>Tile set: <a href="https://ccrgeek.wordpress.com/2016/01/01/mv-school-tile-set/">Candy Coded Response</a></li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>The code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/v2.6.2/resources/Project%20Templates/Basic">Phaser Basic Project Template</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>
