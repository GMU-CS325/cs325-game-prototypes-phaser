<h2>Detention Escape</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
While the game is loosely based on the children's game of "red light, green light", this game is different by 
	having four directions of "checking" by the detector and there are obstacles (students) to hinder your success.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This game features a new level on every playthrough because of the randomly generated obstacles (students), and the random
	behavior of the detector (teacher). Also, it features game states to give the game possibility for replay without having
	to restart the webpage.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
From this prototype, I learned more about the P2 physics system as well as how to handle collisions between character and groups.
	It was difficult to get used to the style of coding when game states are involves due to the numerous "this.xxx" statements 
	that are needed. Also, it was difficult to create sprites/graphics at a level of satisfaction that I wanted. Eventually
	had to compromise for a more realistic finish time.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

<li>Loading screen/bar: self-made</li>
<li>Main menu screen: self-made</li>
<li>Character sprites: self-made</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A twist on the classic 'Red Light, Green Light' game placed in a school setting.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
"LAST DAY OF SCHOOL"
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Input: keyboard (spacebar to start game, arrow keys to move around</li>
<li>Randomness: generation of obstacles (students) and the direction teacher is facing</li>
<li>Genre: top-down escape game</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This game is testing obstacle creation, as well as incorporating detection events to create a semi-stealth escape game.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to experience an upgraded version of a common childhood game that they may have played on the playground.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player controls the character with arrow keys (up, down, left, right) in order to navigate through a series of immovable 
	desks and students to get to the exit. The game is lost if the teacher spots you not behind a desk. The game is won
	by simply reaching the exit door. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Strategies may include waiting for the teacher to turn around and trying to figure out just how much time it takes for the teacher
	to change directions. This will give the player a general idea of how long they have to actually move.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The main character is placed into detention on the last day of school for not wearing the proper school uniform. 
	This can be evident in the actual sprite models, as the player character is the only one not wearing the same
	clothing as the other students. The teacher is a typical, angry detention supervisor who will chase after you
	if you are caught trying to leave.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target demographic is for anyone of all ages.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game can take around one minute or less to play.
</li>
