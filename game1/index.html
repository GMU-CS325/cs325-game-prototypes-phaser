<h2>Dodge the Saws!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game I created isn't based off any of the given examples from the Phaser website. I had to think of 
    a way to create an object dodging and object collecting game from "scratch".
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Since this is my first digital game, there aren't any highly advanced technical mechanics involved in the game. However, 
    there is a timer/looper which is used to generate the saws endlessly.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned the basics of creating an object dodging, platform game.
The easiest part included figuring out which assets would be relevant to my game while the hardest part was
     implementing the correct way to generate saws endlessly.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All were borrowed from the given sprites page from Phaser or the tutorial page from Phaser.
<ul>
<li>Sprites: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/category/sprites">Sprites page</a></li>
<li>Tutorial: <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game">Tutorial page</a></li>
</ul>
    
    
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I used the structure of the "Making Your First Game" tutorial to get a sense of how everything is placed into the game environment.
    
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
    <i>Dodge the Saws!</i> is a platform-based game where the player must run around dodging saws while collecting diamonds.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
    To be honest, there isn't a strong theme, just a dude walking around dodging saws.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: arrow keys to move around and jump

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>

</ul>
