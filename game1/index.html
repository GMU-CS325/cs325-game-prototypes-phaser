<h2>Dodge the Saws!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game I created isn't based off any of the given examples from the Phaser website. I had to think of 
    a way to create an object dodging and object collecting game from "scratch".
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Since this is my first digital game, there aren't any highly advanced technical mechanics involved in the game. However, 
    there is a timer/looper which is used to generate the saws endlessly.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned the basics of creating an object dodging, platform game.
The easiest part included figuring out which assets would be relevant to my game while the hardest part was
     implementing the correct way to generate saws endlessly.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All were borrowed from the given sprites page from Phaser or the tutorial page from Phaser.
<ul>
<li>Sprites: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/category/sprites">Sprites page</a></li>
<li>Tutorial: <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game">Tutorial page</a></li>
</ul>
    
    
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I used the structure of the "Making Your First Game" tutorial to get a sense of how everything is placed into the game environment.
    
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
    <i>Dodge the Saws!</i> is a platform-based game where the player must run around dodging saws while collecting diamonds.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
    To be honest, there isn't a strong theme, just a dude walking around dodging saws.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>

    <ul>
<li>Input: arrow keys to move around and jump</li>
        <li>Randomness: placement of the saws, diamond, and medkits</li>
</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The mechanics of this game involve simple dodging and collecting by moving the character left and right, or jumping.
</li>

    <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to enjoy themselves playing a simple game where the rules are self-explanatory.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
   
    The player uses arrow keys to perform only unique three actions: move left, move right, and jump. The core mechanic relies on the player's ability
    to correctly move their player for their desired outcome; this may be to dodge the saws, jump for the medkits, or 
    collecting the diamonds. 
    
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Because the game is so simple, there aren't many strategies to implement in this game. However, players may need to think about 
    the balance between taking damage from getting hit by a saw vs. collecting a diamond knowing that there will be chances to 
    heal later. Also, the player may wish to stay near the center of the platform for easier access to the entire platform.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is designed for all audiences.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
To actually win the game, it may take around 2-3 minutes.
</li>

</ul>
