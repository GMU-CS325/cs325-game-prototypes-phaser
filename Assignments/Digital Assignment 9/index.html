        <h2>Brutal Brawl</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Originality:</strong>
                The movement is very wacky, similar to QWERTY and Slime ball
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
                This is a somewhat improved version of digital assignment five. Whereas five depended more on luck, obstacles now fall randomnly from the sky and have a set timer added to it
                to make it be destroyed and hidden after a while. What was also added was adding a way for Phaser to detect collisions between the player and the ground, allowing for future
                implementation of a proper jump and possibly a double jump. In addition, the jumping was made better, as before the it was easier for the players to rotate and fall. Also, I
                removed scaling the sprites, as that messed up the sprite's body. Lastly, an additional atlas and JSON file was added to separate the player data from the obstacle data.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
                Just more fiddling with matterjs. I am disappointed that one cannot change body shape during an animation. I also experimented with timers and matterjs's collision system.
            </li>

                <strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
                Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

                <strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
                Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
                I'd say my game is mostly unique, though there was a game made by someone else earlier in the semester that resembles mine.
                The code for title screen and end screen was given inspiration from Daniel Fuerdinger's Who Killed Doctor Bob?

            <li>
                <strong>High Concept:</strong>
                A two-player game where each person is on a platform and has to avoid getting hit by various obstacles falling from the sky.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Theme:</strong>
                Not applicable for this assignment. I did incorporate the prototype goals/ storyboard into this.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
                Input: Keyboard
                Randomness: From the objects falling from the sky. It can come from anywhere up top
                Play Style: Competitive, as you have to beat the other player.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
                It is evaluating the movement from the player sprites as well as the collision detection. Also the backgrounds and the platform/fighting stage.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
                A feeling of tense uncertainty as they don't know where the obstacles will come from.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Gameplay:</strong>
                The core mechanic is using the keyboard to move around. The objective is to avoid getting hit by the obstacles and be the last man standing.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Strategies:</strong>
                Not moving as much as possible, as the controls are wacky.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
                Funny Valentine's D4C has pulled an unwitting lumberjack from alternate realities to play one of the mysterious master's games.
                The lumberjacks do not know why they are there, only what they must do. Nor does Funny Valentine know the master's ultimate intentions.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Target Audience:</strong>
                The demographic I'm trying to reach are people who like to waste their time on quick games.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Play Time:</strong>
                About 20 seconds before somebody loses.
            </li>

        </ul>
