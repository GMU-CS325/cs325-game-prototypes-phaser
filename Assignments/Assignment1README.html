<h2>Breakout Breakdown</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
The game keeps going faster and faster, until the player inevitably makes a mistake. I say inevitably, because it is unlikely he'll break all the bricks first.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
    That it loads and plays background music on loop.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
    The hardest part was actually trying to copy the code. After that everything else was easy.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
It mostly resembles Breakout. The breakout code was gotten from this URL: <a href="https://stackabuse.com/introduction-to-phaser-3-building-breakout/">Breakout code</a>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The goal is to break all the bricks on the screen or die trying.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The keyboard was used as input. The randomness includes the speed that the ball will increase in and the size of the paddle.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Tense frustration as the ball keeps getting faster and faster.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
    The core mechanic of the game is moving the paddle with the left and right arrows and hitting the ball with the paddle. The ball is used to destroy the bricks, which will happen upon contact.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Keeping watch of the paddle, to make sure it doesn't randomnly change size when they don't expect it.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Not much story in this game. Just a simple paddle trying to break simple bricks.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who are fond of clones of games and who like Breakout.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
About one minute.
</li>
