<h2>Plain Planes On Planes</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
It's a 2-player game where each person has to shoot the other one up. Unfortunately, you can't manually slow down :).
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
    Rather than just one player shooting bullets in a top-down view, my game actually has two players. The game can detect who wins and also to rotate the bullets accordingly.
    The game also uses the concept of a sprite pool and timers to make sure a player can't win just by spewing bullets.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
    The hardest part was literally getting the bullets to move. The easiest part was setting the opening text, which was the same (Almost) as last time.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
It mostly resembles the Tanks minigame from Wii Play! Also Asteroids, which was taken from: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/physics/arcade/asteroids-movement">Asteroids Movement</a>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The goal is to shoot the other player using your bullets.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Planes, mostly. As can be told by the sprite.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The keyboard was used as input. Planes was used as the theme. The game is much more skill-based (deterministic) than random like my first game. The playstyle was competitor (as you need to beat the other player),
    and the genre is a top-down shooter.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
A competitve feeling as each person wants to be the last man (plane?) standing.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
    The core mechanic of the game is moving the plane in different directions and pressing the fire button to shoot bullets. A player cannot go outside the bounds. Movement is similar to planes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
One strategy is to keep in mind that you can't slow down, but that means neither can the other person. This lets you adjust where to fire accordingly.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The Stickman War is beign waged on many fronts. Here, suicide pilots (because these are often suicide missions due to the high rate of dying), try to last one more battle.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who are fond of competitve games and beating other players.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
About one minute. The screen isn't that big.
</li>
