<h2>Getting Away with Murder</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
	Originality lies in the theme of the game where you play a villain.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
	I spent the majority of the time learning how tilemaps work to incorporate it into the map building process. Other than that, I incorporated a means to collide the player with the evidence pieces in the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
		I learned mainly about map design through Tiled and incorporating tilemaps into phaser.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Character sprites: self-made</li>
<li>Music: by Komiku  <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Komiku/Captain_Glouglous_Incredible_Week_Soundtrack/school">Link to song</a></li>
</ul>
</li>


<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A topdown crime-themed game where you play as a corrupt detective who must help the murderer get away with their crime.
</li>


<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Input: keyboard (arrow keys to move around</li>
<li>Randomness: generation of enemies (cops) and their movement</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This game is testing the interaction with tiles and the player.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
To have a completely new experience by playing a game where you play on the antagonistâ€™s team. Also, to experience an interesting and new perspective on crime scenarios. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player controls the character with arrow keys (up, left, right) to navigate through the mostly empty room with pieces of evidence laying about. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Going for the evidence closest to you may be better since you cannot pick up evidence near a cop.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You're a police detective but your friend is an extremely sloppy and careless murderer who left behind way too much evidence. It is your job to clean it up without the cops noticing you!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target demographic is for anyone of all ages.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game can take around two minutes.
</li>
