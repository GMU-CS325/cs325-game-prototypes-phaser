            <h2>Door to Hell</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Originality:</strong>
                    This game is a multiplayer game with one player having point-and-click controls and another player with keyboard controls.
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
                    Had to use tween to move a sprite to the mouse-click location in combination with a check to see if there should be a walking animation or not.
                    Also, made a rudimentary system to keep track of game states of "play" and "end".
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
                    The most challenging part was initially figuring out how to combine a point-and-click experience with multiplayer capability. In addition to that,
                    I had to figure out a way to use tween to move the sprite in a way that it would maintain relatively constant speed depending on a variable duration of the tween.
                    I also learned how to activate animations and face the sprite in the correct direction.
                 
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
                    Used sprites made by 'Alex' and background made by user, 'ansimuz' found on itch.io
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sprites: <a href="https://alexs-assets.itch.io/side-view-game-assets">Sprites page</a></li>

                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
                    N/A
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
                    <i>Door to Hell</i> is a simple multiplayer mind game where player assumes the role of a human and another is Death itself.
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Theme:</strong>
                    The theme is semi-horror and death.
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Input: mouse to move and select options for player 1, arrow keys for player 2</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
                    This game was designed to prototype how to implement point-and-click movement and animation as well as multiplayer capability in a game.
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
                    I want players to have fun playing a simple mind game.
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
                    Player 1: Use mouse to point-and-click for movement as well as selecting which door they want to go through.
                    <br>Player 2: Use the left and right arrow keys to secretly select a door to hide behind.
                    <br>
             
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
                    Because the game is so simple, there aren't many strategies to implement in this game. However, players may need to think about
                    the balance between taking damage from getting hit by a saw vs. collecting a diamond knowing that there will be chances to
                    heal later. Also, the player may wish to stay near the center of the platform for easier access to the entire platform.
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
                    A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
                    How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
                    This game is designed for all audiences.
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
                    To actually win the game, it may take around 2-3 minutes.
                </li>
