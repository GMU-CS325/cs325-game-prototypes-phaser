            <h2>Door to Hell</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Originality:</strong>
                    This game is a multiplayer game with one player having point-and-click controls and another player with keyboard controls.
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
                    Had to use tween to move a sprite to the mouse-click location in combination with a check to see if there should be a walking animation or not.
                    Also, I made a rudimentary system to keep track of game states of "play" and "end". I also had to figure out a way to trigger the sound of a footstep 
                    depending on the current frame of the animation when the player is walking.
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
                    The most challenging part was initially figuring out how to combine a point-and-click experience with multiplayer capability. In addition to that,
                    I had to figure out a way to use tween to move the sprite in a way that it would maintain relatively constant speed depending on a variable duration of the tween.
                    I also learned how to activate animations and face the sprite in the correct direction.
                 
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
                    Used sprites made by 'Alex' and background made by user, 'ansimuz' found on itch.io

                <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
                    <i>Door to Hell</i> is a simple multiplayer mind game where player assumes the role of a human and another is Death itself.
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Theme:</strong>
                    The theme is semi-horror and death.

                <li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Input: mouse to move and select options for player 1, arrow keys for player 2</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
                    This game was designed to prototype how to implement point-and-click movement and animation as well as multiplayer capability in a game.
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
                    I want players to have fun playing a simple mind game.
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
                    Player 1: Use mouse to point-and-click for movement as well as selecting which door they want to go through.
                    <br>Player 2: Use the left and right arrow keys to secretly select a door to hide behind.
                    <br>The main mechanic of the game is just a guessing game where one player has control to commit which is the winning door and which is the losing door. 
                    The first player must then choose which door. There may also be social interactions between the two players, since they will
                    be next to each other and can ask player 2 which door they chose to hide behind.
             
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
                    There aren't any strategies to this game if there are no scial interactions between the players. The strategy may
                    be limited to just tricking or reading the other player's intentions.
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
                   There is no story or background and the setting is just a dark alleyway with two doors. Basically, a 
                    human must choose the correct door to live, or the wrong door to die.
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
                    This game is designed for all audiences.
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
                    Play time for one round is less than one minute. 
                </li>
