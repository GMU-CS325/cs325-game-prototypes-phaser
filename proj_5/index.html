<h2>Your game title</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Reach the end of the level jumping over the ground enemies and sneaking past the floating enemies with invisibility!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the theme of invisibility.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I tried to make the enemies randomly generated and make this a side scroller.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player experience a kind of basic plaformer feel of anticipation when making jumps and sneaking past enemies.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
So in the game right now there is only one frame that doesn't scroll, I was having trouble getting the actual side scrolling to work.  Currently though, the player can jump over enemies on the ground and use the SPACEBAR to turn invisibe and sneak past the enemies floating overhead.  Also, I wanted to implement some kind of end level celebration thing similar to Mario Bros. but I eneded up spending most of my time unsuccessfully trying to get the side scrolling to work how I wanted.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This is supposed to be prototyping enemy generation and sidescrolling concepts.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
I think being able to turn invisible and sneak past enemies is kind of cool, also I really like the art resources I found.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
I didn't really give much though to the characters or story, I guess I would just end up making some narritive similar to Mario or Super Meat Boy. I did envision the game somehow being on another planet in a totally different universe or maybe even underground somewhere.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
No real story to speak of although I guess one wouldn't be too difficult to invent.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Definately targeting casual players.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Well only a minute or two at this point.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Make the right jumps and don't get caught by the floating enemies.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made my game from scratch but I barrowed the assets from someone else. I'm not good at art. All art is from <a href="http://kenney.nl/assets/abstract-platformer">here</a>.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Mario Bros. or Super Meat Boy without the difficulty.
