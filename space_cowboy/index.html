<h2>Your game title</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You are an astronaut tasked with defending Earth from a giant space cow asteroid, a Cowdroid.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I kind of meshed the themes of astroid and very losely, cowboy.  Involving both an asteroid heading toward Earth and cows.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This game is a kind of quirky platformer-esque shooter, with very simple mechanics.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
When playing this game, I want players to feel that anxiety and adrenaline you get when put under pressure by the demand for quick responses after easing into the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The gameplay consists of two main goals, evade the cows and shoot the cows.  The player must use the arrow buttons to navigate and the spacebar to shoot their weapon, avoid touching the cows and rack up points to see how high you can get.  Shooting the cows earns the player points towards the players score, and in the final product some kind of store mechanic might work nicely.  Additionally, the final product might also include some kind of collectable time sensitive power-ups like increased fire rate, spread, or even other types of weapons or armor.  Also, I wanted to put in some kind of health or life system, which would be present in the final product along with an actual final boss in the form of the Cowdroid.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating the basics of phaser and some of the ideas behind a very simple 2D shooter.  More specifically, some of the inner workings behind timing, shooting, and movement, and in general just a basic exploration of the functionality of phaser.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Well, the narrative is barebones, but certainly unique.  It has some of the basic functionality of a 2D shooter.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is set on the moon and the player is an astronaut tasked with protecting Earth from the impending doom of the Cowdroid, the apocolyptic cow-asteroid hybrid.  With the Cowdroid barrelling towards Earth, you must dodge and destroy pieces of the Cowdroid that have broken off while attempting to reach and destroy the Cowdroid to save Earth.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The game doesn't have much of a story, save what was described in the Setting/Premise portion.  The player must make it through the rain of cows to destroy the Cowdroid.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The main target of this game would be casual gamers looking for a quick game or something simple to play for a short amount of time.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game can last as long as you want as the cows will keep coming as long as you keep playing.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
One viable strategy in the early game is dodge and shoot, and later on in the game dodging becomes even more imperitive since the player will have little time to react and the fire rate of their gun is not very high.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
The code was made from scratch but I own none of the art assets.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The only game I can think of the kind of resembles my game is called Last Stand.  It is an zombie survival shooter released as a flash game back in the mid 2000s.
